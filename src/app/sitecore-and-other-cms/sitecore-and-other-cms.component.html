                        <p> The ever-increasing connectivity of people and machines has changed market demands. And, in
                            order to keep up, and at the same time stay competitive, businesses need to adjust to these
                            demands by digitizing their processes and business models. And the content management
                            systems (or digital experience platforms) today serves as the catalyst for a business’
                            complete
                            digital transformation.<br>
                            <br>
                            When it comes to choosing a CMS that helps create personalized digital experiences quickly,
                            Sitecore is what most enterprise-level businesses prefer. After all, <b>Sitecore has been
                                recognized
                                as the global leader in 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience
                                Platforms</b>, and has
                            been among the leaders for the ninth year in a row.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Sitecore is a leading enterprise-level CMS built on ASP.NET </b>used by organizations
                            globally to
                            create seamless and personalized digital experiences.
                            What makes the Sitecore CMS unique is the ability it provides to web content editors and
                            marketers to have complete control over all aspects of their website from social integration
                            and
                            blog posts to advanced personalization, e-commerce and more.<br>
                            <br>
                            Further, Sitecore has its own reusable components repository which has modules contributed
                            by
                            developers and many of these modules are free along with paid ones.
                            Built-in analytics: It comes with in-built analytics feature, empowering website owners
                            to create personalized content unlike many popular CMSs such as Drupal.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Multi-lingual support:</b> For business serving customers across multiple locations is
                            important, however, it requires massive efforts. Also, displaying the content that speaks
                            the language of customers is equally tough. With Sitecore, you can easily create any
                            number of pages displaying content of multiple languages.<br>

                            <b>Complete solution to meet varied needs:</b> Unlike other content management systems,

                            <br>
                            <b>Browser-compatible:</b> Sitecore-powered website can run on any modern browser which
                            is not the case with all popular contemporary CMSs.<br>
