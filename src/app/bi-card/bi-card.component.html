                  <p>

                  <p>The Power BI team has been working tirelessly to integrate AI capabilities into traditional BI
                    scenarios. Because Power BI is constantly evolving, it’s easy to miss, or be unaware of, specific
                    features. There are various AI and ML capabilities currently available in Power BI. The key takeaway
                    here is that Power BI is much more than a “visualization tool”. </p>

                  <p>Data Science and Statistics are complementary of each other. In 1977, The IASC (International
                    Association For Statistical Computing) was formed. The main aim of this association was to link
                    statistical methods, computer technology and the knowledge of domain experts in order to covert data
                    into information and find precise insights from the data</p>
